        <p>Arkose is an early-stage, AI safety field-building nonprofit, with the mission of reducing risks from advanced AI. Our approach will likely encompass a range of activities and responsibilities, primarily involving surveys, calls, and supportive programs.</p>

        <p>Our recent work aims to facilitate discussion and evaluation of potential risks from advanced AI, with a focus on soliciting and engaging with expert perspectives on the arguments and providing resources for stakeholders. Our results can be found at <a href="https://ai-risk-discussions.org">AI Risk Discussions</a>. Going forward, our future work will likely include introducing programs to support researchers interested in contributing to AI safety.</p>

        <p>Arkose was founded by <a href="https://vaelgates.com">Vael Gates</a>, and is in the process of incorporating. At present, we operate as a project of Players Philanthropy Fund, a Maryland charitable trust recognized by IRS as a tax-exempt public charity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (Federal Tax ID: 27-6601178). Arkose is funded by the Survival and Flourishing Fund.</p>
