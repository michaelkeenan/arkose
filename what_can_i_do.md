<h3> Overview of the space </h3>

<p> There are different subareas and research approaches within the field of AI alignment, and you may be a better fit for some than others. 
<ul>
	<li>One of the major rough splits is:</li>
		<ul> 
			<li> <i>theoretical research</i> (e.g. <a href="https://alignment.org/">Alignment Research Center</a>, <a href="https://intelligence.org/">MIRI</a>) versus </li>
			<li> <i>empirical research and engineering</i> (e.g. <a href="https://www.redwoodresearch.org/">Redwood Research</a>, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>, <a href="https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/">DeepMind's alignment teams</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research/">OpenAI's safety team</a>).</li>
		</ul> 
	<li>Academia (e.g. UC Berkeley's <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/">CHAI</a>, NYU's <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/arg/">Alignment Research Group</a>, <a href="https://jsteinhardt.stat.berkeley.edu/">Jacob Steinhardt</a>, <a href="https://www.davidscottkrueger.com/">David Krueger</a>, <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~hendrycks/">Dan Hendrycks</a>) and non-profit research organizations (e.g. <a href="https://www.cooperativeai.com/foundation">Cooperative AI Foundation</a>, <a href="https://far.ai/">FAR</a>) often fall somewhere in between theory and empirical alignment work. (Empirical work often needs access to state of the art models and so is resource intensive.)</li>
	<li>Engineering aimed at AI alignment is almost always in industry, and <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/YDF7XhMThhNfHfim9/ai-safety-needs-great-engineers">ML engineering</a> and research engineers are especially in-demand, but there's also <a href="https://jobs.80000hours.org/?refinementList%5Btags_area%5D%5B0%5D=AI%20safety%20%26%20policy&refinementList%5Btags_role_type%5D%5B0%5D=Software%20Engineering">a range</a> of engineering roles, especially security, and also software.</li>
	<li> There's also work in technical AI governance (e.g. Governance team at OpenAI) and <a href="https://epochai.org/">forecasting</a>. Finally, there are some <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P3Yt66Wh5g7SbkKuT/how-to-get-into-independent-research-on-alignment-agency">independent researchers</a>, outside of academia and formal organizations, who publish on the <a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/">AI Alignment Forum</a> and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/ai#AI_Alignment">LessWrong</a> and tend to do more theory work.</li>

<h3> Interested in working in China? </h3>
<p> AI alignment is a relatively new subfield, and research is currently centered in the US and Europe. State of the art research development is not just taking place in the US and Europe, however, and there is particular need for new technical approaches and research into the AI alignment problem taking place in China.</p>

<div id="governance"><h2> AI Governance </h2>

<p>The Center for the Governance of AI (<a href="https://www.governance.ai/">GovAI</a>) describes the AI governance problem as "the problem of devising global norms, policies, and institutions to best ensure the beneficial development and use of advanced AI" (<a href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/614b70a71b9f71c9c240c7a7/61d48553bf2faf58c3900bd2_GovAI-Research-Agenda.pdf">GovAI Research Agenda</a>). "AI governance" or "longtermist AI governance" is distinct from "AI policy" in its primary focus on advanced AI — the hypothetical general purpose technology — rather than current AI as it exists today. The field believes that different actions, risks, and opportunities come about when focusing on advanced AI systems as compared to more contemporary issues, though <a href="https://www.allandafoe.com/opportunity">AI governance and AI policy naturally interface with each other and have overlapping domains</a>. AI governance has historical roots in the study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_general_intelligence">existential risk</a> and the <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">Effective Altruism</a> community, so much current research draws from these communities, but the field is expanding with time.</p>
