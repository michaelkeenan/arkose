##### Intro ----
#' # Introduction {#introduction}
#'
#' ### Overview {#overview}
#' The following is a quantitative analysis of 97 interviews conducted
#' in Feb-March 2022 with machine learning researchers, who were asked
#' about their perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) now and in
#' the future, with particular focus on risks from advanced AI systems
#' (imprecisely labeled "AGI" for brevity in the rest of this document).
#' Of the interviewees, 92 were selected from NeurIPS or ICML 2021 submissions
#' and 5 were outside recommendations.
#' For each interviewee, a transcript was generated, and common responses were identified and tagged to support quantitative analysis.
#' The <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qNN6GpAl6a4KswxnJcdhN4fqnMQgZ9Vg">transcripts</a>,
#' as well as a qualitative
#' <a href="https://ai-risk-discussions.org/perspectives/introduction">walkthrough of the interviews</a>
#' are available at <a href="https://ai-risk-discussions.org/interviews">Interviews</a>.  
#'
#' ### Findings Summary {#findings-summary}
#' Some key findings from our primary questions of interest (not discussing Demographics or "Split-By" subquestions):
#'  
#' * Most participants (75%), at some point in the conversation, said that they thought humanity would achieve advanced AI (imprecisely labeled "AGI" for the rest of this summary) eventually, but their timelines to AGI varied <a href="#when-will-we-get-agi">(source)</a>. Within this group: 
#'     * 32% thought it would happen in 0-50 years
#'     * 40% thought 50-200 years
#'     * 18% thought 200+ years
#'     * and 28% were quite uncertain, reporting a very wide range. 
#'     * (These sum to more than 100% because several people endorsed multiple timelines over the course of the conversation.)
#' * Among participants who thought humanity would never develop AGI (22%), the most commonly cited reason was that they couldn't see AGI happening based on current progress in AI. <a href="#when-will-we-get-agi">(Source)</a>
#' * Participants were pretty split on whether they thought the alignment problem argument was valid. Some common reasons for disagreement were <a href="#alignment-problem">(source)</a>: 
#'     1. A set of responses that included the idea that AI alignment problems would be solved over the normal course of AI development (caveat: this was a very heterogeneous tag).
#'     2. Pointing out that humans have alignment problems too (so the potential risk of the AI alignment problem is capped in some sense by how bad alignment problems are for humans).
#'     3. AI systems will be tested (and humans will catch issues and implement safeguards before systems are rolled out in the real world).
#'     4. The objective function will not be designed in a way that causes the alignment problem / dangerous consequences of the alignment problem to arise.
#'     5. Perfect alignment is not needed.
#' * Participants were also pretty split on whether they thought the instrumental incentives argument was valid. The most common reasons for disagreement were that 1) the loss function of an AGI would not be designed such that instrumental incentives arise / pose a problem and 2) there would be oversight (by humans or other AI) to prevent this from happening. <a href="#instrumental-incentives">(Source)</a>
#' * Some participants brought up that they were more concerned about misuse of AI than AGI misalignment (n = 17), or that potential risk from AGI was less dangerous than other large-scale risks humanity faces (n = 11). <a href="#merged-extended-discussion">(Source)</a>
#' * Of the 55 participants who were asked / had a response to this question, some (n = 13) were potentially interested in working on AI alignment research. (<a href="#work-on-this_about-this-variable">Caveat for bias</a>: the interviewer was less likely to ask this question if the participant believed AGI would never happen and/or the alignment/instrumental arguments were invalid, so as to reduce participant frustration. This question also tended to be asked in later interviews rather than earlier interviews.) Of those participants potentially interested in working on AI alignment research, almost all reported that they would need to learn more about the problem and/or would need to have a more specific research question to work on or incentives to do so. Those who were not interested reported feeling like it was not their problem to address (they had other research priorities, interests, skills, and positions), that they would need examples of risks from alignment problems and/or instrumental incentives within current systems to be interested in this work, or that they felt like they were not at the forefront of such research so would not be a good fit. <a href="#work-on-this">(Source)</a>
#' * Most participants had heard of AI safety (76%) in some capacity <a href="#heard-of-ai-safety">(source)</a>; fewer had heard of AI alignment (41%) <a href="#heard-of-ai-alignment">(source)</a>.
#' * When participants were followed-up with ~5-6 months after the interview, 51% reported the interview had a lasting effect on their beliefs <a href="#lasting-effects">(source)</a>, and 15% reported the interview caused them to take new action(s) at work <a href="#new-actions">(source)</a>.
#' * Thinking the alignment problem argument was valid, or the instrumental incentives argument was valid, both tended to correlate with thinking AGI would happen at some point. The effect wasn't symmetric: if participants thought these arguments were valid, they were quite likely to believe AGI would happen; if participants thought AGI would happen, it was still more likely that they thought these arguments were valid but the effect was less strong. <a href="#main-questions-x-main-questions">(Source)</a>
#' 
#' ### Tags {#tags}
#' The tags were developed arbitrarily, with the goal of describing common
#' themes in the data. These tags are succinct and not described in detail. Thus,
#' to <b>get a sense for what the tags mean, please search the tag name in the
#' <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FlBcctFLWTYY3NiIklgcuQtVYxuU-plDmUeQjn-2Cfk/edit?usp=sharing">Tagged-Quotes</a>
#' document</b>,
#' which lists most of the tags used (column 1) and attached quotes (column 2).
#' (This document is also available in <a href="https://ai-risk-discussions.org/interviews">Interviews</a>.)
#'
#' Many of the tags are also rephrased
#' and included in the <a href="https://ai-risk-discussions.org/perspectives/introduction">walkthrough of the interviews</a>.
#'
#' ### Limitations {#limitations}
#' There are two large methodological weaknesses that
#' should be kept in mind when interpreting the results. First, not every
#' question was asked of every researcher. While some questions were just
#' added later in the interview process, some questions were intentionally
#' asked or avoided based on interviewer judgment of participant
#' interest; questions particularly susceptible to this have
#' an "About this variable" section below to describe the situation in
#' more detail.
#'
#' The second issue is with the tagging, which was somewhat
#' haphazard. One person (not the interviewer) did the majority of the
#' tagging, while another person (the interviewer) assisted and
#' occasionally made corrections. Tagging was not blinded, and
#' importantly, tags were not comprehensively double-checked by the
#' interviewer. If anyone reading this document wishes to do a more
#' systematic tagging of the raw data, we welcome this: much of the
#' raw data is available on this website for analysis, and we're happy
#' to be contacted for further advice.
#'
#' With these caveats in mind, we think there is much to be learned
#' from a quantitative analysis of these interviews and present the
#' full results below. 
#' 
#' ###### Note: All error bars represent standard error.
#'
#' ### About this Report {#about-this-report}
#' There are two versions of this report: one with interactive graphs,
#' and one with static graphs. To access all of the features of this

#' ## What area of AI? {#what-area-of-ai}
#' Area of AI was evaluated in two ways. First, by asking the participant
#' directly in the interview (Field1) and second, by looking up participants'
#' websites and Google Scholar Interests (Field2).
#' A comparison of Field1 and 
#' Field2 is located <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NQmMC8v_MxRreDomEDLD8_XkCDLOO1QJ/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
#' The comparison isn't particularly close, so we usually include 
#' comparisons using both Field1 and Field2. We tend to think the 
#' Field2 labels (from Google Scholar and websites) are more accurate 
#' than Field1, because the data was a little more regular and the tagger 
#' was more experienced. We also tend to think Field2 has better 
#' external validity: for both field1 and field2, we ran a correlation
#' between proportion of participants in that field who found the 
#' alignment arguments valid and those who found the instrumental 
#' arguments valid. This correlation was much higher for [field2](#field2corr) than 
#' [field1](#field1corr). Given that we expect these two arguments are probing a 
#' similar construct, the higher correlation suggests better 
#' external validity for the field2 grouping.

#' <i> Note: "AGI" stands in for "advanced AI systems", and is used for brevity</i>
# "When do you think we'll get AGI / capable / generalizable AI / have the cognitive capacities to have a CEO AI if we do?"
#'
#' * Example dialogue: "All right, now I'm going to give a spiel. So, people talk about the promise of AI, which can mean many things, but one of them is getting very general capable systems, perhaps with the cognitive capabilities to replace all current human jobs so you could have a CEO AI or a scientist AI, etcetera. And I usually think about this in the frame of the 2012: we have the deep learning revolution, we've got AlexNet, GPUs. 10 years later, here we are, and we've got systems like GPT-3 which have kind of weirdly emergent capabilities. They can do some text generation and some language translation and some code and some math. And one could imagine that if we continue pouring in all the human investment that we're pouring into this like money, competition between nations, human talent, so much talent and training all the young people up, and if we continue to have algorithmic improvements at the rate we've seen and continue to have hardware improvements, so maybe we get optical computing or quantum computing, then one could imagine that eventually this scales to more of quite general systems, or maybe we hit a limit and we have to do a paradigm shift in order to get to the highly capable AI stage. Regardless of how we get there, my question is, do you think this will ever happen, and if so when?"

#' ### Split by Field {#when-will-we-get-agi_field}
#' Visualizing AGI time horizon broken down by field is tricky, because
#' participants could be tagged with multiple fields *and* with 
#' multiple time horizons. So if, say, someone in the Vision field
#' was tagged with both '<50' and '50-200' time horizons, including
#' both tags on a bar plot would give the impression that there
#' were actually *two* people in Vision, one with each time horizon.
#' This would result in an over-representation of people who
#' had multiple tags (n = `r sum(table(rowSums(whenAGIdata_simp))[c("2","3")])`). 
#' Thus, for only the cases where we are examining time-horizon 
#' split by field, we simplified by assigning one time-horizon per
#' participant: if they ever endorsed 'wide range', they were assigned
#' 'wide range'; otherwise, they were assigned whichever of their
#' endorsed time horizons was the soonest.

#' ## Instrumental Incentives {#instrumental-incentives}
#' "What do you think about the argument: ‘highly intelligent systems will have an incentive to behave in ways to ensure that they are not shut off or limited in pursuing their goals, and this is dangerous'?"
#'
#' * Example dialogue: "Alright, next question is, so we have a CEO AI and it's like optimizing for whatever I told it to, and it notices that at some point some of its plans are failing and it's like, "Well, hmm, I noticed my plans are failing because I'm getting shut down. How about I make sure I don't get shut down? So if my loss function is something that needs human approval and then the humans want a one-page memo, then I can just give them a memo that doesn't have all the information, and that way I'm going to be better able to achieve my goal." So not positing that the AI has a survival function in it, but as an instrumental incentive to being an agent that is optimizing for goals that are maybe not perfectly aligned, it would develop these instrumental incentives. So what do you think of the argument, "Highly intelligent systems will have an incentive to behave in ways to ensure that they are not shut off or limited in pursuing their goals and this is dangerous"?"

#' ## Work on this {#work-on-this}
#' This question was asked in many different ways, which is not ideal,

#' elicit an answer to was: 
#' "Would you work on AI alignment research?"
#'
#' * Some of the varied question prompts:
#' "Have you taken any actions, or would you take any actions, in your work to address your perceived risks from AI?",
#' "If you were working on these research questions in a year, how would that have happened?", 
#' "What would motivate you to work on this?"
#' "What kind of things would need to be in place for you to either work on these sort of long-term AI issues or just have your colleagues work on it?"
#' 
#' * The varied question prompts resulted in some unusual tags. In particular, 
#' the tag "says Yes but working on near-term safety" means that the
#' interviewer meant to ask whether the participant was working in 
#' long-term safety (safety aimed at advanced AI systems), but the 
#' participant interpreted the question as asking about 
#' their involvement in general safety research, and replied "Yes" for
#' working on near-term safety research.

#' ### About this variable {#work-on-this_about-this-variable}
#' **Response Bias:** The interviewer tended not to ask this
#' question to people who believed AGI would never happen and/or the
#' alignment/instrumental arguments were invalid, to reduce interviewee
#' frustration. (One can see this 
#' effect in the "None/NA" categories for "Split by: When will we 
#' get AGI?", "Split by: Alignment Problem", and "Split by: Instrumental
#' Incentives" below.) Thus,
#' it is not surprising that people who gave these responses to
#' those questions were less likely to have data for "Work on this."
#' We've further learned from the data below that those who had not
#' heard of AI alignment and those who had not heard of AI safety
#' were also less likely to have data for "Work on this."  
#' **Order effects:** The interviewer put a greater emphasis on
#' asking this question as the study went on, so participants
#' later in the study were more likely to be asked. See graphs
#' below depicting the presence of a response X interview order.

#' 
#' Notes about variables used in the matrices below:
#
#' * If someone had no answer in a category, they were encoded as
#' a missing value.
#' * h-index: The outlier was not removed because we used Spearman
#' correlations, which are rank-ordered and therefore robust to outliers.
#' * professionalrank_ord: Professional rank was broken into 4 levels for the ordinal analysis. 
#'     * Level 4 = "Undergraduate", "Masters"
#'     * Level 3 = "PhD", "Research Engineer", "Software Engineer", "ML Engineer", "Researcher / Masters", "Technical Staff", "Principal Research Staff Member", "Architect", "Research Manager", "Research Staff", "Data Scientist"
#'     * Level 2 = "Postdoc", "Assistant Professor", "Research Scientist", "Physics Fellow Researcher", "AI Research Resident"
#'     * Level 1 = "Professor", "Senior Research Fellow", "Senior Research Scientist", "Associate Professor", "CEO", "Principal AI Scientist", "Chief Architect", "Head of Research"
#' * university / industry size ranked: Note that values only exist 
#' for a person who falls into the associated sector (i.e. industry 
#' and academic rank are split into different variables).
#' * indust_size_ranked: This was converted into a rank-ordered variable 
#' (i.e. "under10_employees"=1, 10-100_employees=2, and so on); the 
#' single instance of "50k+_employees / under10_employees" was removed.
#' * AGI_willhappen: wonthappen=0, both=1, willhappen=1
#' * alignment_valid: invalid.other=0, valid=1 (see <a href="#alignment-problem_field">categorization</a>: if someone *ever* said valid, then they were tagged as valid)

#' someone as knowing what AI alignment was without knowing what
#' AI safety was, since alignment is a subfield of safety.) If
#' you've heard of AI safety, there's about a 50/50 shot you've heard
#' of AI alignment as well, but if you haven't heard of AI safety,
#' you're very unlikely to have heard of AI alignment.
#' * People who said that they changed their minds during the interview
#' were more likely to report later that the interview had a lasting effect 
#' on their beliefs. Similarly, if they said they didn't change their mind,
#' they were less likely to report a lasting effect. 
#' * In this data, if you think the alignment argument is valid,
#' you probably think AGI will happen. If you think AGI will
#' happen, you're definitely more likely to think the alignment problem
#' argument is valid but it's not a given. It's almost like thinking
#' that AGI will happen is a prerequisite for thinking the alignment
#' problem argument is valid. 
#' Similar trends hold true for the instrumental incentives argument.
#' * Almost all of the people who said the interview caused them to
#' take new action(s) at work had never heard of AI alignment.
#' * None of the people who reported that the interview caused them 
#' to take a new action(s) at work had said they were interested in 
#' working on AI alignment research during the interview; see more 
#' detail <a href="#new-actions_work-on-this">here</a>.
