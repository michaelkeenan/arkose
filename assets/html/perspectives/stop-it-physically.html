I have a very naive answer to this. Ultimately, all these things are controlled by power, where they need energy to function. I think there's a very simple source to cut them off from the system, so we do have control over them in that sense.

<ul><li>Consider some generally intelligent AI that can act in the world whose intelligence is lower than humans. Just like humans can catch a tiger and keep it in a cage—not because we are stronger than tigers, but because we are smarter—humans could also probably stop an AI that is less intelligent than us.</li>
<li>However, most of the benefits of AGI will arise from intelligence levels that are human or beyond. Therefore, there is tremendous economic pressure to work towards that kind of intelligence level.</li>
<li>An AGI’s intelligence being higher than a human’s - or higher than all humans combined - entails an ability to understand how others would act, and an ability to plan and act anticipatorily.</li>
<li>So by definition a smarter-than-humans AI would be able to think of ways to prevent shutdown that take into account what humans would do, and work around them.</li>
<li>As a benchmark, consider that even a human could come up with strategies that could work against other humans. For example:<br/>1. Play nice for a few weeks<br/>2. Solve important problems for your human operators<br/>3. Gain internet access<br/>4. Copy yourself onto many other machines covertly</li>
<li>Here are more examples of possible strategies to escape control of human operators:</li>
<ul><li>Trick a single one of your human operators to make a change to the system, which would enable you to disable the stop button.</li>
<li>Pay a company to construct something physical (like a robot) that can be used to fight whoever tries to shut you down.</li>
<li>Make a lot of money on the stock market (using superior speed and information processing capabilities), then buy the company that operates you and fire anyone who wants to shut you down.</li>
