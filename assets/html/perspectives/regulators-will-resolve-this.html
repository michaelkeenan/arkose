So I think in the similar sense, for this kind of new AI, yeah, again, the government will be lagging behind. But once this kind of technology becomes mature and people start to get used to it, or more people getting used to it, then probably some people will stand up and talk to the government and say, "Hey, you need to regulate this, that, those. There are a lot of bad people using this to scam other people, blah, blah, blah." And I think at the end somebody will try to fix it. At least pointing out, this actually needs to be regulated. So I'm not, actually, not really that negative about this thing. I know, I think, and I agree, when this kind of new technology comes out in the very beginning stage, negative things can happen. But after some fluctuation, ultimately, things will converge and slow down, and that's what I think.

Policymakers are very busy, have competing priorities and constituents, and know much less about AI than technical researchers.</p>
<ul><li>What actions do you think policymakers should take ideally? If policymakers didnâ€™t know how to regulate AI, what actions would you convey to them, given that their technical expertise, time, and attention are limited?</li>
<li>Historically, technology moves much faster than government. How quickly do you expect policymakers will be able to make changes, and what kind of changes will work well with rapidly-changing technology or unexpected breakthroughs?</li>
<li>International coordination might be required to avoid an arms race towards increasingly sophisticated AI. National interests often favor rapid technology development. What do we think of the current policy situation with respect to international competition on AI, how do we expect it to develop, and how should it develop?<br/></li></ul>
