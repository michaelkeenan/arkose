If we are saying that the whole system is designed perfectly and it's us who are feeding in the wrong goals, then isn't it the human's problem that they then try to use it correctly? And if the system is not designed correctly, then we should have first tested it to make sure that it doesn't go towards the edge cases and start harming us. If humans are the ones who design the system, they should know at least when it will work and some cases when it won't work. And we should have created some kind of a test. And also some cases like you cannot go beyond this, if you go beyond this and try to do this, we shut you off.

<p>AI systems frequently fail when encountering out-of-distribution data. By necessity, an AGI in the real world would often operate far outside its training envelope.</p>
An AI system can be deceptively aligned, i.e. display safe behavior in the training environment but then do the wrong thing in the testing environment.
<ul><li>An AI employing deception may seem like a far-fetched scenario. However, forms of deception have already been observed even in relatively simple systems: In <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03453' target='_blank'>The Surprising Creativity of Digital Evolution</a>, Ofria (see the section “Learning to Play Dumb on the Test”) recounts their experience from a 2001 simulated biology study published in Nature. In this study, evolutionary programming led to organisms being able to detect whether or not they were in the training environment, and radically change their behavior between the “normal” and “test” environments. This is an example of deception arising from training pressures, without even requiring general intelligence.</li>
<li>In <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14111' target='_blank'>Goal Misgeneralization in Deep Reinforcement Learning</a> (ICML 2022), Langosco et al. provide the first empirical demonstrations of goal misgeneralization: In a simple toy environment, an agent learns the wrong objective due to slight distributional shifts between training and testing environment. This system is not an AGI with an intention to deceive - nevertheless, the outcome has parallels: The system displays safe behavior in training but pursues the wrong goal in the test environment. A later paper by DeepMind <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01790.pdf' target='_blank'>Goal Misgeneralization: Why Correct Specifications Aren’t Enough For Correct Goals</a>  provides a more general definition of goal misgeneralization and further examples in new settings.</li>
<li>It is possible that a hypothetical AGI system could form an intention to deceive. Very useful AI systems – anything close to “general intelligence” – will likely have a model of the world that includes itself and its internal processes, and will be able to track changes in its external environment and adjust its internal behavior accordingly. (Noting that in a training environment, actions the AI takes affect this local environment and are probably reversible. In a deployment scenario, actions the AI takes impact the overall structure of the world.) If an AI is pursuing an initially internalized goal, it may observe its goal structure being modified in “training” and “test” environments, and that to have any effect on reality with respect to its current goal, the AI needs to behave satisfactorily within these local environments before it will be deployed. Therefore, the AGI may try to optimize for acceptable-to-overseers behavior in these environments, even if it behaves differently once it is deployed.</li>

</ul></ul>There is a long history of dangerous technology being deployed prematurely, before the technology was understood well enough to be safe. Some examples:
<ul><li>Radioactive toothpaste being sold in Germany in the 1920s</li>
<li>Early passenger aircraft (like the de Havilland Comet ) had rectangular windows, before it was understood that rectangular features put too much stress on the airframe, leading to several disasters.</li>
<li>The Therac-25 radiation treatment machine which killed several people due to a programming error.</li>
<li>The dangerous reactor design which contributed to the Chernobyl disaster.<br/></li>
</ul><p>Additionally, if the use of a technology could result in wide-scale negative outcomes, testing procedures need to be exceptionally thorough to prevent such outcomes, since unilateral action from the more careless/clueless or ill-intentioned user could result in disaster orcompounding errors, as was true of e.g. <a href='https://youtu.be/_ptmjAbacMk?t=799' target='_blank'>the Bhopal disaster, as explained in this analysis</a>. It would not be surprising if testing was not sufficiently thorough to protect from these worst-case scenarios.</p>
