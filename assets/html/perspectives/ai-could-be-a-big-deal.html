<div class="page-data" data-page-title="AI could be a big deal"></div>[ https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1912/1912.00747.pdf ] compares the future development of transformative AI with previous technological innovations. They emphasize that the industrial revolution produced sudden changes in global average GDP - change of a kind never before seen in human history. The authors further argue that this kind of change has “practically irreversible change in trajectories of human life and progress”. “Practically irreversible” might mean, among other things, that products and services become so embedded in society that our lives become dependent on them. An example of that from the past would be electricity.
<div>Even narrow AI might already have a transformative effect on society. This is particularly true if AI is used to speed up technological progress [ https://www.cold-takes.com/forecasting-transformative-ai-whats-the-burden-of-proof/ ].</div>
