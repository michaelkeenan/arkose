<ul><li>Current AI systems are fairly narrow in that they might be very strong in a particular task, but do not come close to covering the full spectrum of human ability.</li>
<li>One of the original promises of AI was the development of generally capable systems. These systems might have the cognitive capabilities to replace almost all current human jobsâ€”for example, you could have a CEO AI or a scientist AI (whether or not we choose to actually replace humans).</li>
<li>We will define Artificial General Intelligence vaguely as a system that is able to perform almost all intellectual activities that a human can. This is imprecise, but works for our purposes.</li>
