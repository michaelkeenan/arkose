<p>This is the end of the walkthrough on researcher perspectives about potential risks of advanced AI. We hope you found the experience engaging, and a productive exploration of discussion on the development and deployment of highly capable AI.</p>
<p>This series was originally based on arguments and counterarguments discussed during a set of interviews Vael Gates had with 97 AI researchers, and we’re eager to add your insights and perspectives. Your beliefs, in terms of agreements and disagreements, have been added to the plots below describing what readers of this site think about potential risks from AI.</p>
